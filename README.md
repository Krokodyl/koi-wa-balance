# Koi wa Balance - English

English translation for the 1996 Satellaview (an extension of the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo only released in Japan) game Koi wa Balance: Tatoeba K-kun no Tabou na Ichinichi Hen<br/>
The Japanese title (恋はバランス たとえばK君の多忙な一日編) roughly translates to "Love is balance - for example, K's busy day".<br/>

This is a party for up to 4 players in which you play as one of four brothers who are competing in a challenge set up by their dying grand-father, head of the family business. They have to roam the city, pick up girls and take them on dates. The players who gets the most kisses by the end of the game is the new heir of the company.
Despite this weird premise, the game has no sexual content beyond a few innuendos. The main screen says "players 6 and older".

## How to play

From the main screen, there is a Rules menu with explanations on how to play.

The game is played like a board game. <br/>
Players take turns.<br/>
On your turn, you can either move or use an item.<br/>
You move around by spinning a roulette (0 to 4).<br/>

## Spaces

There are different spaces on the board<br/>

Space | Effect
------------ | -------------
![image 01](screenshots/spaces/gift.png) | P space gives you a random gift.<br/>(P stands for Present or プレゼント _purezento_ in Japanese)
![image 01](screenshots/spaces/item.png) | I space gives you a random item.
![image 01](screenshots/spaces/empty.png) | Empty space triggers a random event which depends on what gifts you have, your current status, your current date, etc.
![image 01](screenshots/spaces/date.png) | Date spaces do nothing unless you are dating the right girl. In which case, you get a number of kisses depending on your current status.

You can hold up to 4 gifts and 4 items.

## Dates

At the start of the game, 3 girls will appear on the board.<br/>
All players are "single" at the beginning.<br/>
To pick up a girl, you don't need to land on the same space, you can just walk over that space.<br/>
When you do, the girl will tell you where she wants you to take her.<br/>
The name of your date appears under yours indicating that you are "dating" and no longer "single". (Some items and events have different effects depending on that distinction)<br/>
Take your date to her desired location (You can just walk over it) and you'll score a number of hearts.
After each date, a new girl appears on the board.
