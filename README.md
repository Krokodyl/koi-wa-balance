# Koi wa Balance - English

English translation for the 1996 Satellaview (an extension of the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo only released in Japan) game **Koi wa Balance: Tatoeba K-kun no Tabou na Ichinichi Hen**.<br/>
The Japanese title (恋はバランス たとえばK君の多忙な一日編) roughly translates to "Love is balance - for example, K's busy day".<br/>

Sometimes referred as **Koi ha Balance - Battle of Lovers** (は is _ha_ when out of context but read as _wa_ as a particle).

This is a party game for up to 4 players in which you play as one of four brothers who are competing in a challenge set up by their dying grand-father, head of the family business. They have to roam the city, pick up girls and take them on dates. The players who gets the most kisses by the end of the game is the new heir of the company.
Despite this weird premise, the game has no sexual content beyond a few innuendos. The main screen says "players 6 and older".

## How to play

From the main screen, there is a Rules menu with explanations on how to play.

The game is played like a board game. <br/>
Players take turns.<br/>
On your turn, you can either move or use an item.<br/>
You move around by spinning a roulette (0 to 4).<br/>

## Spaces

There are different spaces on the board<br/>

## Dates

At the start of the game, 3 girls will appear on the board.<br/>
All players are "single" at the beginning.<br/>
To pick up a girl, you don't need to land on the same space, you can just walk over that space.<br/>
When you do, the girl will tell you where she wants you to take her.<br/>
The name of your date appears under yours indicating that you are "dating" and no longer "single". (Some items and events have different effects depending on that distinction)<br/>
Take your date to her desired location (You can just walk over it) and you'll score a number of kisses/hearts.
After each date, a new girl appears on the board.

## Gift Battle

There is an explanation, in game, the first time you get a gift battle.

When a single player and a dating player land on the same space, a gift battle starts.
Players place up to 4 of their gifts on a balance to tip it in their favor and win the girl.
The single player goes first, the dating couple goes second.
Press the d-pad and the gift will be placed on the balance.
You can take back the gift you put on with B.
See descriptions of your gifts by holding Y and the d-pad.
Press X when you're done placing presents.
The tipping side wins. The dating player wins ties.
The girl goes to the winner, the loser is warped randomly on the map.
The balance is about numbers and also a girl's preference.
Some combinations of presents grant set bonuses.


## Game End

The game ends when all 13 girls have been taken on a date.
