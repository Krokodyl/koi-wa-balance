------------------------------- THE GAME -------------------------------

This is a party game for up to 4 players in which you play as
one of four brothers who are competing in a challenge set up
by their dying grand-father, head of the family business.
They have to roam the city, pick up girls and take them on dates.
The player who gets the most kisses by the end of the game is the
new heir of the company.

Despite this weird premise, the game has no sexual content beyond
a few innuendos. The main screen says "players 6 and older".
